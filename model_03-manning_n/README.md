Note: discharge plot shows that a manning coefficient of 10 (versus
baseline of 1) is significantly different: 

- slower to peak (by 1 day) 
- slower to rising limb (by 1 day) 
- higher peak (38%) 
- less total annual discharge (15%)

This motivates a check for actual dependency on manning's n...:
3_manning_* are runs for 5 hours on 2 years (to make sure they finish
both years) to look at the dependency of discharge on Manning's n.
