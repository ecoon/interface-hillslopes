Regions:
downhill:
- surface point
- vertical plane
- 10cm deep
- 40cm deep
- 1m deep

uphill:
...

- subsurface lateral flow (downhill plane)
- subsurface lateral flow (uphill plane) (extensive integral of mass_flux) -- 

- surface temperature (uphill & downhill surface point)  (surface-temperature)
- temperature (uphill & downhill / 10cm, 40cm, 1m ) (temperature)


at average, max, uphill, downhill:
- thaw depth
- water table depth

at uphill point, downhill point:
- surface-subsurface exchange (infiltration)   surface-subsurface_flux
- wetness index / saturated fraction
